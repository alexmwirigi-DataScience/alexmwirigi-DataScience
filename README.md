# Alex Mwirigi â€” Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | AI for Healthcare Advocate

Welcome to my portfolio. Iâ€™m a data science and machine learning student based in Kenya, currently sharpening my skills through rigorous, hands-on learning. My mission is to leverage AI to solve real-world problems, especially in healthcare, where I believe intelligent systems can transform how people across Africa access care.

Iâ€™m currently developing personal and collaborative projects, building an AI skillset grounded in data cleaning, model development, and deployment â€” all while preparing to launch **"I AM YOUR DOCTOR"**, a digital AI-powered health assistant for everyday Kenyans.
