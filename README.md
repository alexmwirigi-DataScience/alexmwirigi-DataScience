# Alex Mwirigi — Machine Learning Engineer | Founder, Kenya School of AI 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in Kenya, building full-stack AI systems that solve real problems. My focus is healthcare, education, and building tools that create impact — not just demos.

I am the founder of the **Kenya School of Artificial Intelligence (KSAI)**, a free, open-access learning initiative that trains students across Africa in AI and machine learning — with a practical, self-paced syllabus built for the local context.

I’m currently developing and deploying end-to-end projects, and actively contributing to open-source education in AI.

## Final Note

I build AI systems that solve real problems, not just pass benchmarks. If you’re building for Africa, interested in healthcare innovation, or want to collaborate on mission-driven technology, let’s connect.

Let’s lead Africa’s AI revolution — with action, not just ambition.
