# Alex Mwirigi — Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I’m a data science and machine learning student based in Kenya, focused on solving real-world problems using artificial intelligence. My core mission is to build AI systems that improve lives — starting with healthcare in Africa.

Currently, I'm developing and deploying machine learning projects while pursuing professional training through platforms like ALX, Coursera, and Udemy. These efforts support my broader goal: launching **"I AM YOUR DOCTOR"**, an AI-powered virtual health assistant that will increase access to affordable, intelligent medical insights across Kenya and beyond.

## Launch: Kenya School of Artificial Intelligence (KSAI)

In 2025, I launched a free, self-paced AI learning platform — **Kenya School of Artificial Intelligence (KSAI)** — to empower students and aspiring engineers across Kenya with locally relevant AI skills.

View the full syllabus and learning roadmap here:  
[https://alexmwirigi-datascience.github.io/ksai-syllabus/](https://alexmwirigi-datascience.github.io/ksai-syllabus/)

The goal is to democratize access to AI knowledge, especially for students without formal training opportunities. It’s built for Africa, by Africans.
