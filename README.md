# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Mwirigi – Aspiring Data Scientist & AI for Healthcare Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate data science student and AI explorer from Kenya, committed to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence to create positive change. With a solid foundation built from hands-on courses on **Udemy**, **ALX**, and **Coursera**, I’ve honed my skills in key areas such as:

- 📊 **Statistics & SQL** – Data manipulation and analysis for actionable insights
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Ensuring data is ready for meaningful analysis
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – Building predictive models to solve real-world problems
- 💻 **Python Programming** – The backbone of my data science projects
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Communicating insights effectively using tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

I'm currently working on several hands-on projects and striving to master AI tools to support my dream of creating **"I AM YOUR DOCTOR"**, an AI-powered digital hospital that will revolutionize healthcare access and outcomes in Kenya and beyond.

🔗 Feel free to check out my projects and see how I’m applying my learning to solve complex challenges.


## 📚 Learning Journey
